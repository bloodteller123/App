# App

## Intro
For this project, our team developed Rentsapp, an Android mobile app using Kotlin, to provide a seamless platform for landlords and tenants to communicate and streamlinethe process of renting properties. With Rentsapp, landlords can list their properties for rent, 
while potential tenants can browse available units and contact the landlords for more information.
